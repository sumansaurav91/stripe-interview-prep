## 1. Coding Challenge (45 min)

### Question

You're building a dispute resolution system for Stripe. Given an array of payment events, return the longest streak of consecutive successful payments for a merchant.

#### Event Structure
Each event looks like:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  merchantId: string;
  status: "succeeded" | "failed" | "pending";
  timestamp: number; // Unix epoch seconds
}
```

#### Requirements
- A streak means consecutive chronological events for that merchant with status = "succeeded"
- Return a map `{ merchantId: longestStreak }`
- Handle millions of events efficiently

### Answer / Approach

#### Algorithm Steps
1. **Group events by merchantId**
2. **Sort each group by timestamp**
3. **Scan sequentially to count streaks**

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting, O(n) scan
- **Optimization**: If upstream data is already time-ordered, drop sort â†’ O(n)

### TypeScript Solution

```typescript
type Event = {
  id: string;
  merchantId: string;
  status: "succeeded" | "failed" | "pending";
  timestamp: number;
};

function longestStreak(events: Event[]): Record<string, number> {
  const grouped: Record<string, Event[]> = {};
  
  // Group events by merchantId
  for (const e of events) {
    (grouped[e.merchantId] ||= []).push(e);
  }

  const result: Record<string, number> = {};
  
  // Process each merchant's events
  for (const [merchantId, list] of Object.entries(grouped)) {
    list.sort((a, b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp);
    
    let longest = 0, cur = 0;
    for (const e of list) {
      if (e.status === "succeeded") {
        cur++;
        longest = Math.max(longest, cur);
      } else {
        cur = 0;
      }
    }
    
    result[merchantId] = longest;
  }
  
  return result;
}
```

### Edge Cases
- **Merchant with no successes** â†’ streak = 0
- **Multiple merchants** â†’ each independent
- **Millions of events** â†’ watch memory; could stream events sorted by merchant, timestamp (merge-sort style)

### Production Considerations
- Store events partitioned by `(merchant_id, timestamp)` in DB â†’ avoid per-merchant sort
- Precompute streak counters in warehouse for dashboards

## 2. Full-Stack / System Design (60 min)

### Question

**"Design a refund service for Stripe merchants."**

Merchants can request refunds for charges.

#### Requirements
- Support partial & full refunds
- Refunds should be idempotent (same refund request can be retried)
- Must handle asynchronous processing (refunds can take minutes)
- Provide API + dashboard view
- Scale to tens of millions of refunds/day

### Answer (Stripe-level)

#### Core APIs

```http
POST /v1/refunds
Body: {
  charge_id,
  amount?, 
  reason?, 
  idempotency_key
}

GET /v1/refunds/:id

GET /v1/refunds?charge_id=...

POST /v1/webhooks/refunds (for status updates)
```

#### Refund Lifecycle
```
pending â†’ processing â†’ succeeded | failed
```

#### DB Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE refunds (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  charge_id UUID NOT NULL,
  merchant_id UUID NOT NULL,
  amount_cents BIGINT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending','processing','succeeded','failed')),
  reason TEXT,
  idempotency_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(merchant_id, idempotency_key) -- ensures idempotency
);
```

#### Flow

1. **Request**: Merchant POSTs refund with idempotency key
2. **Validation**:
   - Ensure charge exists & refundable
   - Check idempotency (same merchant + key â†’ return existing record)
3. **Persist**: Insert refund row with pending
4. **Async Worker**: Picks refund, calls external payment rails (ACH, card network)
5. **Update**: Refund becomes processing, then webhook updates â†’ succeeded or failed
6. **Notify**: Merchant can GET or receive webhook

#### Scale
- Partition refunds by `(merchant_id, created_at)` for queries
- Kafka/Kinesis queue for async refund jobs
- DLQ for failed attempts
- Ensure at-least-once delivery but with idempotency guard

#### Frontend

**Dashboard React UI**:
- "Request refund" modal
- Refund list view with filters (status/date)
- Status updates via polling or WebSocket â†’ real-time

---

## 3. API / Product Design (45 min)

### Question

**"Design an API for webhook management at Stripe."**

Merchants want to register, test, and manage webhooks.

### Answer

#### Endpoints

```http
POST /v1/webhook_endpoints
Body: {
  url,
  events: ["payment_intent.succeeded", "charge.refunded"],
  secret?
}

GET /v1/webhook_endpoints

GET /v1/webhook_endpoints/:id

POST /v1/webhook_endpoints/:id/test

DELETE /v1/webhook_endpoints/:id
```

#### Features

- **Multiple endpoints per merchant**
- **Event filtering** â†’ less noise for merchants
- **Secret rotation** â†’ security best practices
- **Retry policies + DLQ** â†’ handle endpoint downtime

#### Developer Experience

- **Dashboard UI** for quick setup
- **Test webhook** with example payload
- **Clear error messages** for misconfigured URLs (timeouts, 500s)

#### Versioning

- Webhooks tied to **Stripe API version** of account
- **Breaking changes** â†’ require opt-in per endpoint

## 4. Debugging / Technical Deep Dive (30 min)

### Scenario

A merchant complains: **"Refund requests sometimes succeed, sometimes fail with duplicate refund error."**

#### Logs

```http
POST /v1/refunds
Idempotency-Key: refund-123
Response: 200 OK {
  refund_id: r1,
  status: "succeeded"
}

POST /v1/refunds
Idempotency-Key: refund-123
Body differs:
  { charge_id: c1, amount: 2000 } vs. { charge_id: c1, amount: 1500 }
Response: 409 Conflict "duplicate refund"
```

### Answer

#### Root Cause
- **Same idempotency key** used with **different payloads**
- Stripe guarantees idempotency only if request body is identical
- Different amount = conflict

#### Debugging Steps

1. **Compare stored payload hash** vs. new request
2. **Look at merchant integration code** â†’ are they reusing a static key?
3. **Check client retries** â†’ is the library setting keys properly?

#### Fix

1. **Educate merchant**:
   - Idempotency key must be **unique per refund attempt**
   - But **consistent across retries** of that same attempt

2. **Add middleware**:
   - Hash request body on first use
   - Reject mismatched reuse

3. **Improve error docs**:
   - Clarify "duplicate refund" vs. "conflict on idempotency"

## 5. Behavioral / Stripe Values (30 min)

### Q1: Tell me about a time you simplified a complex system for end users

#### Answer (STAR Format)

**Situation**: Our EKS-based pipeline produced opaque errors â†’ users confused

**Task**: Improve developer experience

**Action**: Built error mapper â†’ mapped low-level infra errors to clear categories (auth, quota, network)

**Result**: Ticket volume dropped 30%, dev onboarding much smoother. Shows **"Users First."**

### Q2: Describe a time you identified a scaling bottleneck before it became a production issue

#### Answer

**Situation**: High API traffic (200/s) â†’ Postgres read spikes

**Task**: Anticipate failure before peak season

**Action**: Ran load tests, spotted missing index on `(account_id, created_at)`. Added composite index + read replicas

**Result**: Sustained 10x load in production without incident. Shows **"High Standards & Rigor."**

### Q3: Why Stripe?

#### Answer

"I'm excited by Stripe's mission of **growing the GDP of the internet**. My experience building scalable APIs, idempotent systems, and event-driven pipelines aligns directly with Stripe's challenges â€” **correctness and developer experience**. Stripe's culture of **rigor and empathy** is exactly what I want to contribute to."
