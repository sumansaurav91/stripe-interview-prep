## üéØ Stripe-Style Mock Interview Questions

### 1. Coding Challenge (45 minutes)

**Problem**: Transaction Reconciliation Tool

You're building a reconciliation tool for Stripe. Given two lists of transactions (Stripe's internal ledger and bank statement), return all unmatched transactions.

**Transaction Structure**:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  amount: number,
  currency: string
}
```

**Requirements**:
- Return transactions appearing in one list but not the other
- Handle performance for large datasets (millions of records)
- Assume `id` is unique within each list

**Follow-up Questions**:
- How would you handle discrepancies (same ID, different amounts)?
- What's your approach for a production system?
- How would you optimize for memory-constrained environments?

### 2. System Design (60 minutes)

**Problem**: Invoice Generation System

Design a system for generating and sending invoices to businesses via Stripe.

**Requirements**:
- Backend API endpoints (create, list, pay, webhook updates)
- Database schema design
- Frontend React UI for invoice creation
- Scalability for millions of invoices across regions
- Stripe-specific considerations (idempotency, retries, fraud prevention)

**Discussion Points**:
- API versioning and backwards compatibility
- Async processing for PDF generation and email delivery
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Multi-currency and multi-region support

### 3. API Design (45 minutes)

**Problem**: Subscription Billing API

Design an API for developers to set up subscription billing (similar to Netflix using Stripe).

**Requirements**:
- Define 2-3 core endpoints
- Handle trial periods, cancellations, and failed payments
- Ensure developer-friendly design
- Plan for API versioning without breaking existing integrations

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- API consistency and predictability
- Error handling and status codes
- Documentation and developer experience
- Scalability and performance considerations

### 4. Technical Deep Dive (30 minutes)

**Scenario**: Payment Failure Analysis

A Stripe dashboard shows "Payment Failed" for 5% of transactions. Logs indicate:
```
Error: PaymentIntent confirmation failed - idempotency key reused
```

**Your Task**:
- Identify potential root causes
- Outline debugging approach
- Propose solutions (code, infrastructure, or product changes)
- Discuss prevention strategies

### 5. Behavioral Questions (30 minutes)

#### Sample Questions:

1. **Users First**: "Tell me about a time you built something with strong focus on end-user experience."

2. **High Standards**: "Describe a piece of code or system you're most proud of, and why."

3. **Think Rigorously**: "Walk me through a technical decision that required deep analysis of tradeoffs."

4. **Collaboration**: "Tell me about a time you worked across different teams and faced misalignment. How did you handle it?"

5. **Why Stripe?**: "What excites you about Stripe's mission and engineering culture?"
