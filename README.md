Got it 🚀 — let’s break this down into a Stripe-specific prep plan for a Full Stack Software Engineer interview. Stripe interviews are known to be rigorous, engineering-driven, and product-focused, so you’ll need to prepare across coding, systems, product sense, and Stripe’s values.

📌 Stripe Interview Process (Typical)

Recruiter Screen

Background, motivation, Stripe interest, role fit.

Technical Screen (Coding)

1–2 Leetcode-style problems (medium-hard).

Emphasis on correctness, readability, performance.

Onsite / Final Loop (Virtual or In-person)
Usually 4–5 rounds:

Coding (DSA, algorithms)

Full Stack / System Design

API / Product Design

Technical Deep Dive (architecture + debugging)

Behavioral / Stripe Values Interview

🖥️ 1. Coding & Algorithms

Stripe expects strong CS fundamentals:

Data Structures: arrays, hash maps, heaps, graphs, tries.

Algorithms: BFS/DFS, recursion, binary search, sorting, dynamic programming.

Complexity: Be clear on time vs. space tradeoffs.

Leetcode: Focus on Medium/Hard.

Stripe favorites:

Interval problems (merge intervals, insert interval)

String parsing (valid parentheses, regex-like problems)

Graph/DFS/BFS (course schedule, word ladder)

Hashing/LRU cache

Greedy + DP (scheduling, coin change)

👉 Practice explaining your thought process out loud (they value clarity).

🌐 2. Full Stack / Systems Design

For a Full Stack Engineer, Stripe will probe both frontend + backend:

Backend

Designing APIs (REST/GraphQL style). Be prepared to design an API endpoint, handle versioning, errors, idempotency (important at Stripe!).

Scalable systems: e.g.,

“Design a payments system for subscriptions.”

“Design a rate limiter for APIs.”

Databases:

Tradeoffs: SQL vs. NoSQL

Transactions, indexes, schema migrations

Stripe often values idempotency keys & consistency in distributed systems.

Frontend

You may be asked to build a small React component:

Form with validation

Fetching + rendering API data

Handling async states

Focus on clarity, reusability, and testing.

💳 3. Product / API Design Round

Stripe engineers are very product-minded.
They’ll test your ability to:

Think like a product engineer: “If you were designing an invoicing API for small businesses, what would the endpoints look like?”

Balance developer experience with correctness:

How easy is it for a developer to integrate?

How safe is it against errors or fraud?

Communicate tradeoffs clearly.

🛠️ 4. Technical Deep Dive

Debugging session: Given a buggy service or failing test, walk through logs/code and fix it.

Could involve SQL queries, backend logs, React components.

🧠 5. Behavioral & Stripe Values

Stripe looks for engineers who care deeply about users and systems. Be ready for:

Why Stripe? (Payments infra is Stripe’s DNA — mention interest in solving global financial problems, developer-first tools).

Ownership: Times you took initiative.

Collaboration: Working across teams.

Resilience: Stripe likes people who dive into messy problems.

Stripe’s values you should echo:

Users first (developer empathy, customer focus)

High standards (clean, robust code)

Think rigorously (justify choices with data, not vibes)

Be Optimistic & Pragmatic (balancing big vision + practicality)

📚 Preparation Plan (4–6 weeks)

Week 1–2: Coding

Leetcode Mediums daily (intervals, graphs, DP).

Practice explaining out loud.

Week 2–3: Backend & API Design

Design 2–3 systems (e.g., Payments, Notifications, Rate Limiter).

Study idempotency, retries, event-driven systems.

Week 3–4: Frontend

Build small React projects (form handling, state management).

Practice live coding UI in 30–40 min.

Week 4–5: Mock Interviews

Pair with a friend or use platforms like Pramp/Interviewing.io.

Week 6: Behavioral

Prepare STAR stories: ownership, debugging, scaling, cross-team collaboration.

Refine Why Stripe pitch.

⚡ Pro tip: Stripe loves clarity + rigor.
When solving problems, narrate like:

Clarify requirements

Explore approaches

Pick tradeoffs

Implement cleanly

Reflect on improvements

Do you want me to create a Stripe-style mock interview question set (coding + API/system design + behavioral), so you can actually practice like the real thing?

You said:
Yes, create one for me
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — let’s set up a Stripe-style mock interview packet for you. I’ll include coding, full stack/system design, product/API design, and behavioral so you can simulate a real Stripe loop.

🎯 Stripe Full-Stack Engineer Mock Interview
1. Coding (45 min)

👉 Question:
You are building a transaction reconciliation tool for Stripe. Given two lists of transactions (one from Stripe’s internal ledger, and one from a bank statement), return all unmatched transactions.

Each transaction has:

{
  id: string,
  amount: number,
  currency: string
}


Return transactions that appear in one list but not the other.

Consider performance for large datasets (millions of records).

Assume id is unique within each list.

Follow-up:

What if transactions can appear in both lists with the same id but different amount (discrepancy)?

How would you handle it in a production system?

2. Full Stack / System Design (60 min)

👉 Question:
“Design a system for generating and sending invoices to businesses via Stripe.”

Discuss:

Backend API endpoints (create invoice, list invoices, pay invoice, webhook for payment updates).

Database schema (tables for users, invoices, payments, line_items).

Frontend flow (React UI for creating an invoice, showing status).

Scalability: Handling millions of invoices across regions.

Stripe considerations: Idempotency keys, retries, fraud prevention.

3. API / Product Design (45 min)

👉 Question:
“Imagine you’re designing an API for developers to set up subscription billing (like Netflix using Stripe). What would the API look like?”

Define 2–3 endpoints (e.g., POST /subscriptions, GET /subscriptions/:id, DELETE /subscriptions/:id).

How would you handle trial periods, cancellations, and failed payments?

How do you ensure the API is developer-friendly?

How do you version it without breaking old integrations?

4. Debugging / Technical Deep Dive (30 min)

👉 Scenario:
A Stripe dashboard shows “Payment Failed” for 5% of transactions. Logs show:

Error: PaymentIntent confirmation failed - idempotency key reused


Walk through what might be happening.

How would you debug it?

What fixes would you propose (code, infra, or product changes)?

5. Behavioral / Stripe Values (30 min)

👉 Sample Questions:

Users First: Tell me about a time you built something with a strong focus on the end-user experience.

High Standards: What’s a piece of code or system you’re most proud of, and why?

Rigor: Describe a technical decision you made that required deep analysis of tradeoffs.

Collaboration: Tell me about a time you worked across different teams and faced misalignment. How did you handle it?

Why Stripe? What excites you about Stripe’s mission?

✅ If you practice these thoroughly, you’ll be in great shape for Stripe.

Would you like me to also write out detailed solutions & ideal answers for each section (coding implementation, system design diagrams, API specs, and sample behavioral answers), so you can compare your attempt vs. “Stripe-level expectations”?

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 14s

Awesome — here’s a complete Stripe-style answer key you can practice against. It includes ideal solutions, tradeoffs, and sample phrasing you can reuse in an interview.

1) Coding — Reconciliation (ideal solution)
Problem

Given two large lists of transactions (Stripe ledger vs. bank), return:

unmatched: present in one list but not the other (by id)

discrepant: same id exists in both, but amount or currency differ

Constraints & goals

Scale to millions of rows

O(n + m) time, O(n + m) space (or streaming alternatives)

TypeScript reference solution
type Tx = { id: string; amount: number; currency: string };

function reconcile(stripe: Tx[], bank: Tx[]) {
  const map = new Map<string, Tx>();
  for (const t of stripe) map.set(t.id, t);

  const unmatched: Tx[] = [];
  const discrepant: { id: string; stripe?: Tx; bank?: Tx; reason: string }[] = [];

  // Walk bank, check against Stripe map
  for (const b of bank) {
    const s = map.get(b.id);
    if (!s) {
      unmatched.push(b); // in bank not in stripe
    } else {
      // same id exists; check discrepancy
      if (s.amount !== b.amount || s.currency !== b.currency) {
        discrepant.push({
          id: b.id,
          stripe: s,
          bank: b,
          reason: [
            s.amount !== b.amount ? `amount ${s.amount} != ${b.amount}` : "",
            s.currency !== b.currency ? `currency ${s.currency} != ${b.currency}` : "",
          ].filter(Boolean).join("; ")
        });
      }
      map.delete(b.id); // consumed
    }
  }

  // what remains in map are in stripe but not in bank
  for (const s of map.values()) unmatched.push(s);

  return { unmatched, discrepant };
}


Complexity: O(n + m) time; O(n + m) extra space.

Edge cases

Duplicate IDs within a single feed (should not happen; if it does, dedupe or flag as data quality issue).

Floating amounts vs. integer cents — store as integer minor units to avoid FP errors.

Different currencies: treat as discrepancy, not convertible.

Production considerations

Streaming/External sort for memory limits:

If feeds are too large, sort both by id (external merge sort) and do a linear merge in O(1) extra memory (besides buffers).

Data quality:

Enforce uniqueness constraints at ingest.

Validate schemas.

Auditability:

Persist a reconciliation run record with counts and samples.

Idempotent runs:

Key each run by (source snapshot ids, date) to avoid double-processing.

2) Full Stack / System Design — Invoicing via Stripe (ideal answer)
Goal

Build an end-to-end invoicing system: create invoices, send to customers, accept payments, track status, and surface results in a dashboard. Optimize for correctness, idempotency, and developer ergonomics.

High-level architecture

Frontend (React): Invoice builder, list/detail, payment status.

Backend (API, e.g., NestJS/Express): AuthN/Z, invoice CRUD, idempotent mutations, integration with Stripe (PaymentIntents/Invoices), webhooks receiver.

DB (PostgreSQL): accounts, customers, invoices, line_items, payments, events.

Async: Queue for email sending, PDF rendering, and webhook processing.

Storage: Object store for PDF invoices.

Observability: Metrics (invoices created/paid/failed), logs with correlation IDs, traces.

API endpoints (v1)

POST /v1/invoices
Body: { customer_id, currency, due_date, line_items: [{description, unit_price, quantity, tax_rate_id?}], memo?, send_email?: boolean }
Headers: Idempotency-Key: <uuid>

GET /v1/invoices/:id

POST /v1/invoices/:id/send (enqueue email + generate PDF)

POST /v1/invoices/:id/pay (creates Stripe PaymentIntent if not present; client_secret returned)

GET /v1/invoices?customer_id=&status=&cursor=&limit=

POST /v1/webhooks/stripe (verifies signature, enqueues events)

POST /v1/invoices/:id/cancel

POST /v1/invoices/:id/void

DB schema (PostgreSQL)
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  account_id UUID REFERENCES accounts(id),
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT,
  UNIQUE (account_id, email)
);

CREATE TYPE invoice_status AS ENUM ('draft','sent','viewed','paid','void','past_due','uncollectible');

CREATE TABLE invoices (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  account_id UUID REFERENCES accounts(id),
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
  currency TEXT NOT NULL,
  status invoice_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft',
  subtotal_cents BIGINT NOT NULL,
  tax_cents BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  total_cents BIGINT NOT NULL,
  due_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  stripe_payment_intent_id TEXT,
  pdf_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE line_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  invoice_id UUID REFERENCES invoices(id),
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  unit_price_cents BIGINT NOT NULL,
  quantity INT NOT NULL,
  tax_rate NUMERIC(5,2) DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TYPE payment_status AS ENUM('requires_payment_method','processing','succeeded','failed','canceled','refunded','partial');

CREATE TABLE payments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  invoice_id UUID REFERENCES invoices(id),
  stripe_payment_intent_id TEXT,
  amount_cents BIGINT NOT NULL,
  status payment_status NOT NULL,
  raw JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Outbox/events for reliability
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  aggregate_type TEXT,
  aggregate_id UUID,
  type TEXT,
  payload JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

Core flows

Create & send invoice

Client → POST /invoices (with Idempotency-Key).

Server validates, computes subtotal/total in minor units, writes invoice + line items in a transaction.

Enqueue PDF render & email job; update status: 'sent'.

Store PDF in object storage; email contains a hosted “Pay Now” link.

Pay invoice

Client hits POST /invoices/:id/pay.

Backend ensures one PaymentIntent per invoice (reuse if exists).

Return client_secret to the client to confirm payment via Stripe Elements.

Stripe emits webhooks (e.g., payment_intent.succeeded).

Webhook handler (idempotent) updates payments + invoices.status='paid'.

Webhooks

Verify signature.

Use idempotency table keyed by event.id.

Process asynchronously (queue) to avoid timeouts.

Idempotency

All create/update endpoints require Idempotency-Key.

Persist request hash; if a key is reused with different body, return 409 (conflict).

Retry-safe: client can retry without double effects.

Scale & reliability

Hot partitions: paginate by (created_at, id) and use composite indexes.

Multi-region: region-anchored accounts; write-local/read-global; replicate using logical replication. Webhook processing per region with global de-dupe by event.id.

Queues: DLQs for failed jobs; exponential backoff.

Backfills: use outbox → worker → Stripe to keep side effects reliable.

Security

OAuth/JWT per account; row-level access checks.

PII minimization; store only necessary customer data.

Encrypt at rest; rotate keys; strict secrets management.

3) API / Product Design — Subscriptions (ideal answer)
States

inactive → active → past_due → canceled (+ trialing, paused optional). Billing cycle anchor and proration rules matter.

Minimal endpoints (v1)

POST /v1/subscriptions

GET /v1/subscriptions/:id

DELETE /v1/subscriptions/:id (cancel now or at period end)

POST /v1/subscriptions/:id/pause / /resume (optional)

POST /v1/webhooks/stripe

Request/response examples

Create subscription

POST /v1/subscriptions
Idempotency-Key: 9b9e...

{
  "customer_id": "cus_123",
  "items": [
    { "price_id": "price_basic", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "trial_days": 14,
  "payment_behavior": "default_incomplete", 
  "collection_method": "charge_automatically", 
  "coupon_code": "WELCOME10"
}


Response

{
  "id": "sub_abc",
  "status": "trialing",
  "current_period_end": "2025-09-12T00:00:00Z",
  "latest_invoice_id": "inv_987",
  "client_secret": "pi_client_secret_..."  // if payment needed
}


Get

GET /v1/subscriptions/sub_abc


Response includes items, status, next invoice estimate, past_due reasons.

Cancel

DELETE /v1/subscriptions/sub_abc?at_period_end=true

Key behaviors & tradeoffs

Trials: set trial_end = now + N days; convert automatically at period end; remind via email.

Failed payments:

Retry schedule (e.g., 1h, 24h, 3d, 7d).

Dunning: send emails, update portal banner, eventually mark past_due → canceled.

Proration:

When changing tier mid-cycle, compute delta for remaining period; optionally disable via proration_behavior=none.

Versioning:

URL versioning (/v1, /v2) + Stripe-Version style header for behavior changes.

Deprecate gracefully with sunset headers and migration docs.

DX:

Consistent error shapes:

{ "error": { "code": "invalid_request", "message": "price_id unknown", "param": "items[0].price_id" } }


Idempotency required for all writes.

Webhook types documented with examples.

SDKs in JS, Python, Java with typed models.

4) Debugging / Deep Dive — “idempotency key reused”
Symptom

5% of payments show: PaymentIntent confirmation failed - idempotency key reused.

Likely causes

Client retries with the same idempotency key but a different request body
Stripe treats this as a conflict (safety feature). E.g., first attempt: amount=1000; retry sends amount=1200 with same key → failure.

Server reuses a single idempotency key across multiple distinct operations
e.g., same key for different PaymentIntents.

Race conditions
Multiple clicks “Pay” generate concurrent confirmations with one key.

Webhook confusion
App treats webhook re-deliveries as “we should confirm again” and accidentally re-hits confirm with an old key.

Debug plan (what you’d say aloud)

Correlate by request_id / idempotency key in logs.

Compare first-seen request body hash vs. retries. If mismatch → root cause.

Inspect client code for key generation scope (should be 1:1 with a logical operation).

Check network timeouts: client may retry before server returns, causing double-confirm.

Validate webhook handler is idempotent and never calls confirm.

Sample 20 failures; confirm pattern.

Fixes (code + process)

Generate one idempotency key per logical op, store it, and reuse only if the body is bit-for-bit identical.

Confirm on client only once; disable duplicate clicks; debounce.

Server-side guard:

Keep a table: (idempotency_key, sha256(body), status, result_reference).

On reuse with different sha: respond 409 conflict with stored canonical params.

Backoff & visibility: exponential backoff on 5xx/timeouts; alert on >0.5% conflicts.

NestJS-style patch (sketch)

// middleware: enforce idempotency on writes
@Injectable()
export class IdempotencyMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  async use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    const key = req.header('Idempotency-Key');
    if (!key) return res.status(428).json({ error: { code: 'missing_idempotency_key' }});

    const bodyHash = sha256(JSON.stringify(req.body));
    const existing = await this.repo.findOne({ where: { key } });

    if (!existing) {
      await this.repo.insert({ key, body_hash: bodyHash, status: 'pending' });
      return next();
    }
    if (existing.body_hash !== bodyHash) {
      return res.status(409).json({ error: { code: 'idempotency_conflict' }});
    }
    if (existing.status === 'succeeded') {
      return res.json(existing.cached_response);
    }
    return next(); // pending or failed → allow retry
  }
}

5) Behavioral — Stripe Values (sample STAR answers you can tailor)
Users first — “Making a painful task effortless”

S: Our EKS-based event API processed ~200 req/s; finance team struggled to reconcile failures.
T: Reduce user pain: add clear failure reasons and self-serve retries.
A: Added structured error codes and an “idempotent replay” endpoint; surfaced status in UI with filters.
R: Reduced support tickets by 48%, median time-to-resolution from 2h → 15m. Shows empathy + measurable impact.

High standards — “Preventing regressions at scale”

S: Memory heap/CPU spikes every 8 hours on a NestJS service.
T: Make the system stable under continuous load.
A: Added p99 profiling, capped concurrency, optimized ORM N+1, introduced circuit breakers, and right-sized pod requests/limits; added load test in CI.
R: Eliminated OOMKills, cut p95 latency 40%, stabilized autoscaling. Demonstrates craftsmanship.

Think rigorously — “Choosing storage for event sourcing”

S: Designing event store in DynamoDB with Postgres read models.
T: Guarantee write throughput + query performance.
A: Benchmarked partition strategies, wrote a simulator for hot partition risk, chose aggregateId as PK, version as SK, introduced outbox → CDC to Postgres, and defined eventually-consistent read patterns.
R: Sustained >50k events/min with zero hot partitions during peak; clean, defensible tradeoffs.

Collaboration — “Unblocking cross-team integration”

S: Auth0 signup metadata missing in post-registration actions; team friction over ownership.
T: Align on a fix without blocking release.
A: Reproduced issue, found SDK field mismatch; proposed a minimal schema change; paired with platform team to deploy.
R: Restored metadata flow, unblocked onboarding, prevented similar issues with a contract test.

Why Stripe? (concise)

“I love Stripe’s focus on developer tools for real businesses. Payments and fintech demand correctness, idempotency, and thoughtful APIs—exactly the kind of rigor I enjoy. I’ve shipped high-throughput services, event-sourced systems, and idempotent APIs; I want to apply that craft where it multiplies global economic access.”

Got it 👍 — let’s build you another full mock interview set for Stripe Full-Stack SWE, with new questions and detailed Stripe-level answers (so you can practice variety).

🎯 Stripe Mock Interview Set #2
1) Coding (45 min)
Question:

You’re building a dispute resolution system for Stripe. Given an array of payment events, return the longest streak of consecutive successful payments for a merchant.

Each event looks like:

{
  id: string;
  merchantId: string;
  status: "succeeded" | "failed" | "pending";
  timestamp: number; // Unix epoch seconds
}


A streak means consecutive chronological events for that merchant with status = "succeeded".

Return a map { merchantId: longestStreak }.

Handle millions of events efficiently.

Answer / Approach

Step 1: Group events by merchantId.

Step 2: Sort each group by timestamp.

Step 3: Scan sequentially to count streaks.

Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting, O(n) scan.

Optimization: If upstream data is already time-ordered, drop sort → O(n).

TypeScript Solution
type Event = {
  id: string;
  merchantId: string;
  status: "succeeded" | "failed" | "pending";
  timestamp: number;
};

function longestStreak(events: Event[]): Record<string, number> {
  const grouped: Record<string, Event[]> = {};
  for (const e of events) {
    (grouped[e.merchantId] ||= []).push(e);
  }

  const result: Record<string, number> = {};
  for (const [merchantId, list] of Object.entries(grouped)) {
    list.sort((a, b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp);
    let longest = 0, cur = 0;
    for (const e of list) {
      if (e.status === "succeeded") {
        cur++;
        longest = Math.max(longest, cur);
      } else {
        cur = 0;
      }
    }
    result[merchantId] = longest;
  }
  return result;
}

Edge cases

Merchant with no successes → streak = 0.

Multiple merchants → each independent.

Millions of events → watch memory; could stream events sorted by merchant,timestamp (merge-sort style).

Production considerations

Store events partitioned by (merchant_id, timestamp) in DB → avoid per-merchant sort.

Precompute streak counters in warehouse for dashboards.

2) Full-Stack / System Design (60 min)
Question:

“Design a refund service for Stripe merchants.”

Merchants can request refunds for charges. Requirements:

Support partial & full refunds.

Refunds should be idempotent (same refund request can be retried).

Must handle asynchronous processing (refunds can take minutes).

Provide API + dashboard view.

Scale to tens of millions of refunds/day.

Answer (Stripe-level)
Core APIs

POST /v1/refunds
Body: { charge_id, amount?, reason?, idempotency_key }

GET /v1/refunds/:id

GET /v1/refunds?charge_id=...

POST /v1/webhooks/refunds (for status updates)

Refund lifecycle

pending → processing → succeeded | failed.

DB Schema
CREATE TABLE refunds (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  charge_id UUID NOT NULL,
  merchant_id UUID NOT NULL,
  amount_cents BIGINT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pending','processing','succeeded','failed')),
  reason TEXT,
  idempotency_key TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(merchant_id, idempotency_key) -- ensures idempotency
);

Flow

Request: Merchant POSTs refund with idempotency key.

Validation:

Ensure charge exists & refundable.

Check idempotency (same merchant + key → return existing record).

Persist: Insert refund row with pending.

Async Worker: Picks refund, calls external payment rails (ACH, card network).

Update: Refund becomes processing, then webhook updates → succeeded or failed.

Notify: Merchant can GET or receive webhook.

Scale

Partition refunds by (merchant_id, created_at) for queries.

Kafka/Kinesis queue for async refund jobs.

DLQ for failed attempts.

Ensure at-least-once delivery but with idempotency guard.

Frontend

Dashboard React UI:

“Request refund” modal.

Refund list view with filters (status/date).

Status updates via polling or WebSocket → real-time.

3) API / Product Design (45 min)
Question:

“Design an API for webhook management at Stripe.”

Merchants want to register, test, and manage webhooks.

Answer
Endpoints

POST /v1/webhook_endpoints
Body: { url, events: ["payment_intent.succeeded", "charge.refunded"], secret? }

GET /v1/webhook_endpoints

GET /v1/webhook_endpoints/:id

POST /v1/webhook_endpoints/:id/test

DELETE /v1/webhook_endpoints/:id

Features

Support multiple endpoints per merchant.

Allow filtering by event types → less noise.

Rotate secrets easily.

Provide retry policies + DLQ if endpoint down.

Developer experience

Provide dashboard UI for quick setup.

Expose Test webhook with example payload.

Clear error messages for misconfigured URLs (timeouts, 500).

Versioning

Webhooks tied to Stripe API version of account.

Breaking change → require opt-in per endpoint.

4) Debugging / Technical Deep Dive (30 min)
Scenario:

A merchant complains: “Refund requests sometimes succeed, sometimes fail with duplicate refund error.”

Logs:

POST /v1/refunds
Idempotency-Key: refund-123
Response: 200 OK { refund_id: r1, status: "succeeded" }

POST /v1/refunds
Idempotency-Key: refund-123
Body differs: { charge_id: c1, amount: 2000 } vs. { charge_id: c1, amount: 1500 }
Response: 409 Conflict duplicate refund

Answer

Root cause:

Same idempotency key used with different payloads.

Stripe guarantees idempotency only if request body is identical.

Different amount = conflict.

Debugging steps:

Compare stored payload hash vs. new.

Look at merchant integration code → are they reusing a static key?

Check client retries: is the library setting keys properly?

Fix:

Educate merchant: idempotency key must be unique per refund attempt, but consistent across retries of that same attempt.

Add middleware: hash request body on first use; reject mismatched reuse.

Improve error docs: clarify "duplicate refund" vs. "conflict on idempotency".

5) Behavioral / Stripe Values (30 min)
Q1: Tell me about a time you simplified a complex system for end users.

A (STAR):

S: Our EKS-based pipeline produced opaque errors → users confused.

T: Improve developer experience.

A: Built error mapper → mapped low-level infra errors to clear categories (auth, quota, network).

R: Ticket volume dropped 30%, dev onboarding much smoother. Shows “Users First.”

Q2: Describe a time you identified a scaling bottleneck before it became a production issue.

A:

S: High API traffic (200/s) → Postgres read spikes.

T: Anticipate failure before peak season.

A: Ran load tests, spotted missing index on (account_id, created_at). Added composite index + read replicas.

R: Sustained 10x load in production without incident. Shows “High Standards & Rigor.”

Q3: Why Stripe?

A:
“I’m excited by Stripe’s mission of growing the GDP of the internet. My experience building scalable APIs, idempotent systems, and event-driven pipelines aligns directly with Stripe’s challenges — correctness and developer experience. Stripe’s culture of rigor and empathy is exactly what I want to contribute to.”

✅ This second set gives you fresh problems + detailed Stripe-grade answers.

Would you like me to now create a condensed “cheat sheet” (1–2 pages) summarizing all these answers — so you can glance at it before your interview instead of re-reading everything?

Perfect 👌 — let’s build 8 fresh Stripe-style Q&A sets (mixing coding, system design, API/product, debugging, and behavioral), each with detailed Stripe-level answers.

📚 Stripe Mock Q&A Set #3
1) Coding — Transaction Settlement Order

Q:
You receive an array of settlement batches:

{ id: string, merchantId: string, amount: number, createdAt: number }


Stripe requires settlements to be processed in chronological order per merchant. Given an array of batches across merchants, return a list sorted so that each merchant’s settlements are in order, but overall processing interleaves merchants fairly (round-robin by merchant).

A:

Group by merchant → min-heap keyed by createdAt.

Use a priority queue to pop the earliest available settlement across merchants in round-robin.

Complexity: O(n log m), where m = merchants.

This ensures fairness + chronological correctness. Stripe often needs this in payout pipelines.

2) Coding — Detect Circular Transfers

Q:
Given transfers between accounts:

{ from: string, to: string, amount: number }


Detect if there is a circular flow of money (e.g., A→B, B→C, C→A).

A:

Model as a directed graph.

Run DFS cycle detection.

Complexity: O(V + E).

This is practical: Stripe needs to detect fraudulent circular laundering.

3) System Design — Rate Limiter for APIs

Q:
Design a rate limiting service for Stripe APIs (e.g., max 100 requests/min per API key).

A:

Algorithm: Token bucket or sliding window.

Storage: Redis (atomic INCR + TTL).

Scale: Sharded Redis cluster, consistent hashing by API key.

Fairness: Burst tolerance via token bucket.

Stripe-specific: Idempotency-safe (don’t penalize retries with same idempotency key).

Frontend impact: Return 429 Too Many Requests with Retry-After header.

4) System Design — Ledger for Multi-Currency Payments

Q:
How would you design a general ledger that supports USD, EUR, INR payments?

A:

Schema:

entries (id, ledger_id, account_id, currency, amount_cents, type [debit/credit], created_at).

Always store amounts in minor units (cents, paise).

Double-entry accounting: every debit has a credit.

Exchange rates: snapshot rate stored at transaction time.

Queries: aggregate by (ledger_id, currency).

Scale: Partition by account_id.

Stripe-specific: correctness > speed; all writes in DB transaction.

5) API/Product — Idempotent Bulk Payouts API

Q:
Design an API for merchants to issue bulk payouts to 1,000+ connected accounts.

A:

Endpoint:

POST /v1/payout_batches
{ payouts: [{account_id, amount, currency}], idempotency_key }


Response: batch_id, each payout has status.

Processing: async queue → mark each payout succeeded/failed.

Idempotency: same idempotency_key returns the same batch_id.

Developer experience: provide GET /payout_batches/:id to check progress.

Stripe-style: correctness (no double-payouts) prioritized over latency.

6) Debugging — Webhook Retries

Q:
Merchant complains: “We see duplicate webhook deliveries for the same event.”

A:

Stripe always retries webhooks until acknowledged (2xx).

If merchant didn’t ack fast enough, duplicates occur.

Debug steps:

Inspect webhook log → confirm event IDs are the same.

Check merchant’s server latency/error rate.

Fix:

Educate: must dedupe by event.id.

Merchant should return 200 OK quickly, and process async.

Stripe-level answer: This is by design; correctness > at-most-once delivery.

7) Debugging — Slow Dashboard Query

Q:
Stripe dashboard page for “All Invoices” is slow when a merchant has 10M invoices.

A:

Problem: naive SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE merchant_id=... ORDER BY created_at.

Fix:

Add composite index (merchant_id, created_at DESC).

Use cursor-based pagination instead of OFFSET/LIMIT.

Precompute aggregates (count, total outstanding).

Stripe-specific: merchants expect sub-second dashboards, even at scale.

8) Behavioral — Stripe Values
Q: Tell me about a time you built something developer-first.

A (STAR):

S: At my last role, developers integrating with our API often hit schema mismatches.

T: Reduce friction in API onboarding.

A: Wrote a typed SDK generator from OpenAPI spec, added sample apps & Postman collections.

R: Integration time dropped from 2 days → 3 hours. Support tickets down 60%.

Shows Stripe value: Users First (developers = users).

✅ Summary of This Set

Coding: Settlement ordering (heap).

Coding: Detect circular transfers (graph).

Design: API rate limiter.

Design: Multi-currency ledger.

API/Product: Bulk payouts.

Debugging: Webhook retries.

Debugging: Slow invoice dashboard.

Behavioral: Developer-first empathy.

Do you want me to now generate one giant practice workbook with ~30 Stripe-style Q&A (like a real prep book) — covering all categories (coding, system, API, debugging, behavioral) — so you can drill through systematically?

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:

🔥 Perfect — let’s build you a Stripe Interview Practice Workbook that feels like the real prep material.

This will be structured into 4 major sections (like Stripe’s loop):

Coding (10 Q&A)

System Design (8 Q&A)

API/Product (6 Q&A)

Debugging & Behavioral (6 Q&A)

Total: 30 curated Stripe-style questions with detailed answers.

📘 Stripe Interview Practice Workbook
Section 1: Coding Challenges (10)
1. Settlement Ordering by Merchant (Heap)

👉 Already covered above — fairness + chronological integrity.

2. Circular Transfers Detection

👉 Already covered — DFS cycle detection.

3. Credit Card Masking

Q: Write a function that takes a card number "4242424242424242" and returns "************4242".

A:

function maskCard(card: string): string {
  return card.slice(0, -4).replace(/\d/g, '*') + card.slice(-4);
}


Stripe-specific: Card data must be tokenized/PCI safe — real code never logs full PAN.

4. Currency Normalization

Q: Convert amounts into minor units (USD: 2 decimals, JPY: 0, KWD: 3).

A:

function toMinorUnits(amount: number, currency: string): number {
  const map: Record<string, number> = { USD: 2, EUR: 2, JPY: 0, KWD: 3 };
  return Math.round(amount * Math.pow(10, map[currency] ?? 2));
}


Stripe always stores integers in DB to avoid float rounding errors.

5. Refund Allocation

Q: Given a charge with 3 line items, refund $50 across them proportionally.

A:

Compute ratio of each line item to total.

Allocate refund = ratio * 50, round carefully to avoid cent mismatch.

Stripe does this to ensure math always balances.

6. Transaction Stream Aggregation

Q: Given a stream of events { accountId, amount }, compute rolling balance per account.

A:

HashMap: balance[accountId] += amount.

Complexity O(n).
Stripe uses similar approach in ledger streaming pipelines.

7. Detect Duplicate Charges

Q: Given a list of charges { idempotencyKey, amount }, remove duplicates.

A:

Use HashSet on idempotencyKey.

Stripe rule: All APIs must be idempotent-safe.

8. Rate Limiting Window

Q: Implement per-user 100 requests per 15 minutes.

A:

Store (userId, windowStart, count).

Reset after 15 minutes.

Production: use Redis TTL + atomic increment.

9. Reconciliation of Events

Q: Stripe ledger has 1,000 events/day. Some events missing in merchant DB. Detect differences.

A:

Use event.id → full outer join.

Merchant should ack every event; missing = alert.

10. Matching Transfers with Refunds

Q: Given payouts and refunds, ensure net zero.

A:

Group by merchant → sum(payouts) - sum(refunds) = balance.

Stripe always enforces ledger consistency.

Section 2: System Design (8)
11. Rate Limiter

👉 Already covered above (Redis + token bucket).

12. Multi-Currency Ledger

👉 Already covered above (double-entry, minor units).

13. Real-Time Fraud Detection System

Q: How to catch suspicious transactions (e.g., $10k charge from new card)?

A:

Stream events → Kafka → ML scoring service.

Features: geolocation, device fingerprint, velocity of charges.

Latency budget: <200ms inline decision.

Stripe prioritizes blocking fraud before authorization completes.

14. Idempotent Payment API

Q: Ensure client retries don’t double-charge.

A:

API requires Idempotency-Key header.

Store result in Redis keyed by (key, endpoint).

Return same response if retried.

15. Webhook Delivery Service

Q: How to design webhook delivery at scale?

A:

Push → retry with exponential backoff.

Deduplication by event.id.

Merchant-facing: must handle at-least-once delivery.

16. Invoicing System

Q: Build a scalable invoice engine.

A:

Tables: invoices, invoice_items, payments.

Generate invoice snapshot at time of issue (immutability).

Support retries + dunning (email, retries).

17. Real-Time Dashboard for 10M Payments

Q: Show merchant dashboard with metrics in <1s.

A:

Use pre-aggregated OLAP store (ClickHouse/BigQuery).

Periodic ETL from ledger.

Serve queries via cached materialized views.

18. Dispute Resolution System

Q: Design chargeback handling.

A:

Store disputes table linked to charges.

Merchant uploads evidence → async workflow.

SLA tracking (must respond within 7 days).

Stripe uses workflow orchestration (Airflow/Step Functions).

Section 3: API & Product (6)
19. Bulk Payouts API

👉 Already covered above.

20. Onboarding API for Connect Accounts

Q: Design API to onboard new connected accounts.

A:

POST /accounts with business info.

Return account_id.

Support KYC → async verification → verified flag.

Stripe: must handle global compliance laws.

21. Subscription API

Q: Design API to create subscriptions.

A:

POST /subscriptions → { customer_id, plan_id }.

Store next invoice date, billing cycle.

Support proration when switching plans.

22. Refund API

Q: API to refund a payment.

A:

POST /refunds { charge_id, amount }.

Must support partial refunds.

Idempotent by (charge_id, idempotency_key).

23. Idempotency Explained to Non-Tech Merchant

Q: How would you explain “idempotency” to a merchant?

A:

“If you click ‘refund’ 3 times, we guarantee it happens only once. Idempotency means no accidental duplicates.”

24. API Error Design

Q: How should Stripe structure errors?

A:

JSON format: { error: { type, code, message, param } }.

Always actionable messages.

Stripe values developer empathy.

Section 4: Debugging & Behavioral (6)
25. Webhook Duplicates

👉 Already covered.

26. Slow Dashboard Queries

👉 Already covered.

27. Memory Leak in Node.js API

Q: EKS pod OOMKilled every 8h. Debug?

A:

Use heap dump → check event listeners/objects not GC’d.

Common bug: caching unbounded user sessions.

Fix: LRU cache or Redis external store.

28. Charge Failing in Production

Q: Merchant reports “all charges failing.”

A:

Check Stripe status page → gateway outage?

Debug logs → invalid API key or expired secret?

Stripe’s approach: prioritize blast radius containment.

29. Behavioral: Disagreement with Teammate

Q: Tell me about a time you disagreed with a peer.

A (STAR):

S: Disagreement over database choice (SQL vs NoSQL).

T: Needed reliable ledger system.

A: Collected metrics, ran spike tests, showed why Postgres met ACID needs.

R: Team aligned, decision accepted.

Shows Stripe value: Seek the Truth, Not Consensus.

30. Behavioral: Users First

Q: Tell me about a time you put users first.

A (STAR):

S: Developer onboarding was slow.

T: Reduce integration pain.

A: Built SDK + examples, wrote better docs.

R: Integration time dropped 70%.

Stripe looks for developer-first empathy.

You said:
Select 40 questions most stripe relevant and created detailed solutions for me
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 15s

Awesome — here are 40 Stripe-relevant coding problems with concise, “interview-ready” solutions (Python), each mapping to real Stripe-ish scenarios like reconciliation, rate limiting, idempotency, batching, and graphy workflows. For each: when it’s relevant at Stripe, approach, clean code, and complexity.

Arrays / Hashing / Intervals
1) Merge Intervals

Stripe-why: reconcile overlapping payout windows, maintenance windows.
Approach: sort by start; sweep & merge.

def merge(intervals):
    intervals.sort()
    out=[]
    for s,e in intervals:
        if not out or s>out[-1][1]:
            out.append([s,e])
        else:
            out[-1][1]=max(out[-1][1],e)
    return out


Complexity: O(n log n). Edge: empty, single interval.

2) Insert Interval

Stripe-why: insert a new maintenance window idempotently.

def insert(intervals, newI):
    res=[]; i=0; s,e=newI
    while i<len(intervals) and intervals[i][1]<s: res.append(intervals[i]); i+=1
    while i<len(intervals) and intervals[i][0]<=e:
        s=min(s,intervals[i][0]); e=max(e,intervals[i][1]); i+=1
    res.append([s,e]); res+=intervals[i:]
    return res


Complexity: O(n). Edge: overlaps at boundaries.

3) Minimum Window Substring

Stripe-why: smallest log slice containing all error codes.

from collections import Counter
def minWindow(s,t):
    need=Counter(t); miss=len(t); i=0; best=(10**9,None,None)
    for j,c in enumerate(s,1):
        if need[c]>0: miss-=1
        need[c]-=1
        if miss==0:
            while i<j and need[s[i]]<0:
                need[s[i]]+=1; i+=1
            if j-i<best[0]: best=(j-i,i,j)
            need[s[i]]+=1; i+=1; miss+=1
    return "" if best[1] is None else s[best[1]:best[2]]


Complexity: O(n). Edge: no window.

4) Longest Substring Without Repeating

Stripe-why: longest streak of unique request IDs.

def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):
    pos={}; i=ans=0
    for j,c in enumerate(s):
        if c in pos and pos[c]>=i: i=pos[c]+1
        pos[c]=j; ans=max(ans,j-i+1)
    return ans


Complexity: O(n).

5) Product of Array Except Self

Stripe-why: compute per-metric contribution without self.

def productExceptSelf(nums):
    n=len(nums); out=[1]*n
    p=1
    for i in range(n): out[i]=p; p*=nums[i]
    p=1
    for i in range(n-1,-1,-1): out[i]*=p; p*=nums[i]
    return out


Complexity: O(n), O(1) extra.

6) Top K Frequent Elements

Stripe-why: most frequent failure codes.

from collections import Counter
def topKFrequent(nums,k):
    return [x for x,_ in Counter(nums).most_common(k)]


Complexity: O(n log n) (or bucket sort O(n)).

7) Longest Consecutive Sequence

Stripe-why: longest consecutive days of payment success.

def longestConsecutive(nums):
    s=set(nums); best=0
    for x in s:
        if x-1 not in s:
            y=x
            while y in s: y+=1
            best=max(best,y-x)
    return best


Complexity: O(n).

8) Subarray Sum Equals K

Stripe-why: find a run of transactions summing to threshold.

from collections import defaultdict
def subarraySum(nums,k):
    pref=0; seen=defaultdict(int,{0:1}); ans=0
    for v in nums:
        pref+=v
        ans+=seen[pref-k]
        seen[pref]+=1
    return ans


Complexity: O(n).

9) 3Sum

Stripe-why: detect offsetting entries that net to zero.

def threeSum(a):
    a.sort(); n=len(a); res=[]
    for i in range(n-2):
        if i and a[i]==a[i-1]: continue
        l,r=i+1,n-1
        while l<r:
            s=a[i]+a[l]+a[r]
            if s<0: l+=1
            elif s>0: r-=1
            else:
                res.append([a[i],a[l],a[r]])
                l+=1; r-=1

Extra Stripe-flavored patterns
41) (Bonus) Reconcile Two Ledgers (Symmetric diff by id)

(Use these two as practice extras; the 40 primary above already cover LeetCode-style breadth.)

How to drill effectively

For each: explain brute force → optimal, note time/space, and test edge cases (empty, large, duplicates, negative, boundaries).

Use integer minor units for money, never floats.

Verbalize invariants (e.g., “window contains all required counts”, “heap holds current ends”, “idempotency: same input → same output”).
