# Stripe Interview Preparation Guide

üöÄ **Full Stack Software Engineer Interview Prep**

This comprehensive guide breaks down everything you need to know for Stripe's rigorous, engineering-driven, and product-focused interview process.

## üìå Stripe Interview Process

### 1. Recruiter Screen
- **Focus**: Background, motivation, Stripe interest, role fit
- **Duration**: 30-45 minutes
- **Format**: Phone/video call

### 2. Technical Screen (Coding)
- **Problems**: 1-2 Leetcode-style problems (medium-hard difficulty)
- **Emphasis**: Correctness, readability, performance
- **Duration**: 60 minutes

### 3. Onsite/Final Loop (Virtual or In-person)
**Usually 4-5 rounds consisting of:**

- **Coding (DSA, algorithms)**
- **Full Stack/System Design**
- **API/Product Design**
- **Technical Deep Dive (architecture + debugging)**
- **Behavioral/Stripe Values Interview**

## üñ•Ô∏è 1. Coding & Algorithms

### Core Requirements
Stripe expects strong Computer Science fundamentals:

#### Data Structures
- Arrays
- Hash maps
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Tries

#### Algorithms
- BFS/DFS traversal
- Recursion
- Binary search
- Sorting algorithms

- Explain Big O notation confidently

### Stripe Coding Favorites

#### Problem Categories to Focus On:

1. **Interval Problems**
   - Merge intervals
   - Insert interval

2. **String Parsing**
   - Valid parentheses
   - Regex-like problems

3. **Graph Traversal**
   - Course schedule
   - Word ladder
   - BFS/DFS applications

4. **Hashing & Caching**
   - LRU cache implementation
   - Hash table operations

5. **Greedy & Dynamic Programming**
   - Scheduling problems
   - Coin change variations

> üí° **Pro Tip**: Practice explaining your thought process out loud - Stripe highly values clarity in communication.

## üåê 2. Full Stack / Systems Design

For Full Stack Engineers, Stripe evaluates both frontend and backend expertise:

### Backend Focus Areas

#### API Design
- **REST/GraphQL**: Design robust API endpoints
- **Versioning**: Handle API version management
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error responses
- **Idempotency**: Critical for payment systems (Stripe specialty!)

#### Scalable Systems Examples
```
"Design a payments system for subscriptions"
"Design a rate limiter for APIs"
"Build a webhook delivery system"
```

#### Database Considerations
- **SQL vs. NoSQL tradeoffs**
- **Transactions and ACID properties**
- **Index optimization**
- **Schema migrations**

### Frontend Considerations
- Component architecture
- State management
- Performance optimization
- User experience patterns

## üìö Additional Preparation Areas

### Product Sense
- Understanding of payment flows
- API design from user perspective
- Business logic implementation

### Stripe Values
- **Move fast**: Bias towards action
- **Think rigorously**: Data-driven decisions
- **Be transparent**: Clear communication
- **Global mindset**: International considerations
