## 1. üíª Coding Challenge (45 minutes)

### Problem Statement

**Transaction Reconciliation Tool**

You are building a transaction reconciliation tool for Stripe. Given two lists of transactions (one from Stripe's internal ledger and one from a bank statement), return all unmatched transactions.

### Requirements

**Transaction Structure:**
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  amount: number,
  currency: string
}
```

**Core Task:**
- Return transactions that appear in one list but not the other
- Consider performance for large datasets (millions of records)
- Assume `id` is unique within each list

### Follow-up Questions

1. **Discrepancy Handling:** What if transactions can appear in both lists with the same id but different amount (discrepancy)?
2. **Production System:** How would you handle it in a production system?

## 2. üèóÔ∏è Full Stack / System Design (60 minutes)

### Problem Statement

**Invoice Generation and Payment System**

Design a system for generating and sending invoices to businesses via Stripe.

### Key Areas to Discuss

#### Backend Architecture
- **API Endpoints:**
  - Create invoice
  - List invoices
  - Pay invoice
  - Webhook for payment updates

#### Database Design
- **Core Tables:**
  - `users`
  - `invoices`
  - `payments`
  - `line_items`

#### Frontend Implementation
- **React UI Components:**
  - Invoice creation flow
  - Status tracking dashboard
  - Payment interface

#### Scalability Considerations
- Handling millions of invoices across regions
- Performance optimization strategies

#### Stripe Integration
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Idempotency keys
  - Retry mechanisms
  - Fraud prevention

## 3. üîå API / Product Design (45 minutes)

### Problem Statement

**Subscription Billing API**

Imagine you're designing an API for developers to set up subscription billing (like Netflix using Stripe). What would the API look like?

### Core Requirements

#### Essential Endpoints
Define 2‚Äì3 primary endpoints:
- `POST /subscriptions`
- `GET /subscriptions/:id`
- `DELETE /subscriptions/:id`

#### Advanced Features
- **Trial Periods:** Implementation and management
- **Cancellations:** Immediate vs. end-of-period
- **Failed Payments:** Retry logic and user communication

#### Developer Experience
- **API Usability:** How do you ensure the API is developer-friendly?
- **Versioning Strategy:** How do you version it without breaking old integrations?

## 4. üêõ Debugging / Technical Deep Dive (30 minutes)

### Scenario

**Payment Failure Investigation**

A Stripe dashboard shows "Payment Failed" for 5% of transactions.

### Error Details
```
Error: PaymentIntent confirmation failed - idempotency key reused
```

### Investigation Steps

1. **Root Cause Analysis:** Walk through what might be happening
2. **Debugging Strategy:** How would you debug this issue?
3. **Solution Design:** What fixes would you propose?
   - Code changes
   - Infrastructure improvements
   - Product modifications

## 5. ü§ù Behavioral / Stripe Values (30 minutes)

### Core Values Assessment

#### Users First
**Question:** Tell me about a time you built something with a strong focus on the end-user experience.

#### High Standards
**Question:** What's a piece of code or system you're most proud of, and why?

#### Rigor
**Question:** Describe a technical decision you made that required deep analysis of tradeoffs.

#### Collaboration
**Question:** Tell me about a time you worked across different teams and faced misalignment. How did you handle it?

#### Company Alignment
**Question:** Why Stripe? What excites you about Stripe's mission?
