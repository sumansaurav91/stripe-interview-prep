üéØ Stripe Full-Stack Engineer Mock Interview
1. Coding (45 min)

üëâ Question:
You are building a transaction reconciliation tool for Stripe. Given two lists of transactions (one from Stripe‚Äôs internal ledger, and one from a bank statement), return all unmatched transactions.

Each transaction has:

{
  id: string,
  amount: number,
  currency: string
}


Return transactions that appear in one list but not the other.

Consider performance for large datasets (millions of records).

Assume id is unique within each list.

Follow-up:

What if transactions can appear in both lists with the same id but different amount (discrepancy)?

How would you handle it in a production system?

2. Full Stack / System Design (60 min)

üëâ Question:
‚ÄúDesign a system for generating and sending invoices to businesses via Stripe.‚Äù

Discuss:

Backend API endpoints (create invoice, list invoices, pay invoice, webhook for payment updates).

Database schema (tables for users, invoices, payments, line_items).

Frontend flow (React UI for creating an invoice, showing status).

Scalability: Handling millions of invoices across regions.

Stripe considerations: Idempotency keys, retries, fraud prevention.

3. API / Product Design (45 min)

üëâ Question:
‚ÄúImagine you‚Äôre designing an API for developers to set up subscription billing (like Netflix using Stripe). What would the API look like?‚Äù

Define 2‚Äì3 endpoints (e.g., POST /subscriptions, GET /subscriptions/:id, DELETE /subscriptions/:id).

How would you handle trial periods, cancellations, and failed payments?

How do you ensure the API is developer-friendly?

How do you version it without breaking old integrations?

4. Debugging / Technical Deep Dive (30 min)

üëâ Scenario:
A Stripe dashboard shows ‚ÄúPayment Failed‚Äù for 5% of transactions. Logs show:

Error: PaymentIntent confirmation failed - idempotency key reused


Walk through what might be happening.

How would you debug it?

What fixes would you propose (code, infra, or product changes)?

5. Behavioral / Stripe Values (30 min)

üëâ Sample Questions:

Users First: Tell me about a time you built something with a strong focus on the end-user experience.

High Standards: What‚Äôs a piece of code or system you‚Äôre most proud of, and why?

Rigor: Describe a technical decision you made that required deep analysis of tradeoffs.

Collaboration: Tell me about a time you worked across different teams and faced misalignment. How did you handle it?

Why Stripe? What excites you about Stripe‚Äôs mission?

‚úÖ If you practice these thoroughly, you‚Äôll be in great shape for Stripe.

Would you like me to also write out detailed solutions & ideal answers for each section (coding implementation, system design diagrams, API specs, and sample behavioral answers), so you can compare your attempt vs. ‚ÄúStripe-level expectations‚Äù?

Awesome ‚Äî here‚Äôs a complete Stripe-style answer key you can practice against. It includes ideal solutions, tradeoffs, and sample phrasing you can reuse in an interview.

1) Coding ‚Äî Reconciliation (ideal solution)
Problem

Given two large lists of transactions (Stripe ledger vs. bank), return:

unmatched: present in one list but not the other (by id)

discrepant: same id exists in both, but amount or currency differ

Constraints & goals

Scale to millions of rows

O(n + m) time, O(n + m) space (or streaming alternatives)

TypeScript reference solution
type Tx = { id: string; amount: number; currency: string };

function reconcile(stripe: Tx[], bank: Tx[]) {
  const map = new Map<string, Tx>();
  for (const t of stripe) map.set(t.id, t);

  const unmatched: Tx[] = [];
  const discrepant: { id: string; stripe?: Tx; bank?: Tx; reason: string }[] = [];

  // Walk bank, check against Stripe map
  for (const b of bank) {
    const s = map.get(b.id);
    if (!s) {
      unmatched.push(b); // in bank not in stripe
    } else {
      // same id exists; check discrepancy
      if (s.amount !== b.amount || s.currency !== b.currency) {
        discrepant.push({
          id: b.id,
          stripe: s,
          bank: b,
          reason: [
            s.amount !== b.amount ? `amount ${s.amount} != ${b.amount}` : "",
            s.currency !== b.currency ? `currency ${s.currency} != ${b.currency}` : "",
          ].filter(Boolean).join("; ")
        });
      }
      map.delete(b.id); // consumed
    }
  }

  // what remains in map are in stripe but not in bank
  for (const s of map.values()) unmatched.push(s);

  return { unmatched, discrepant };
}


Complexity: O(n + m) time; O(n + m) extra space.

Edge cases

Duplicate IDs within a single feed (should not happen; if it does, dedupe or flag as data quality issue).

Floating amounts vs. integer cents ‚Äî store as integer minor units to avoid FP errors.

Different currencies: treat as discrepancy, not convertible.

Production considerations

Streaming/External sort for memory limits:

If feeds are too large, sort both by id (external merge sort) and do a linear merge in O(1) extra memory (besides buffers).

Data quality:

Enforce uniqueness constraints at ingest.

Validate schemas.

Auditability:

Persist a reconciliation run record with counts and samples.

Idempotent runs:

Key each run by (source snapshot ids, date) to avoid double-processing.

2) Full Stack / System Design ‚Äî Invoicing via Stripe (ideal answer)
Goal

Build an end-to-end invoicing system: create invoices, send to customers, accept payments, track status, and surface results in a dashboard. Optimize for correctness, idempotency, and developer ergonomics.

High-level architecture

Frontend (React): Invoice builder, list/detail, payment status.

Backend (API, e.g., NestJS/Express): AuthN/Z, invoice CRUD, idempotent mutations, integration with Stripe (PaymentIntents/Invoices), webhooks receiver.

DB (PostgreSQL): accounts, customers, invoices, line_items, payments, events.

Async: Queue for email sending, PDF rendering, and webhook processing.

Storage: Object store for PDF invoices.

Observability: Metrics (invoices created/paid/failed), logs with correlation IDs, traces.

API endpoints (v1)

POST /v1/invoices
Body: { customer_id, currency, due_date, line_items: [{description, unit_price, quantity, tax_rate_id?}], memo?, send_email?: boolean }
Headers: Idempotency-Key: <uuid>

GET /v1/invoices/:id

POST /v1/invoices/:id/send (enqueue email + generate PDF)

POST /v1/invoices/:id/pay (creates Stripe PaymentIntent if not present; client_secret returned)

GET /v1/invoices?customer_id=&status=&cursor=&limit=

POST /v1/webhooks/stripe (verifies signature, enqueues events)

POST /v1/invoices/:id/cancel

POST /v1/invoices/:id/void

DB schema (PostgreSQL)
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  account_id UUID REFERENCES accounts(id),
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT,
  UNIQUE (account_id, email)
);

CREATE TYPE invoice_status AS ENUM ('draft','sent','viewed','paid','void','past_due','uncollectible');

CREATE TABLE invoices (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  account_id UUID REFERENCES accounts(id),
  customer_id UUID REFERENCES customers(id),
  currency TEXT NOT NULL,
  status invoice_status NOT NULL DEFAULT 'draft',
  subtotal_cents BIGINT NOT NULL,
  tax_cents BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  total_cents BIGINT NOT NULL,
  due_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  stripe_payment_intent_id TEXT,
  pdf_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE line_items (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  invoice_id UUID REFERENCES invoices(id),
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  unit_price_cents BIGINT NOT NULL,
  quantity INT NOT NULL,
  tax_rate NUMERIC(5,2) DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TYPE payment_status AS ENUM('requires_payment_method','processing','succeeded','failed','canceled','refunded','partial');

CREATE TABLE payments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  invoice_id UUID REFERENCES invoices(id),
  stripe_payment_intent_id TEXT,
  amount_cents BIGINT NOT NULL,
  status payment_status NOT NULL,
  raw JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- Outbox/events for reliability
CREATE TABLE events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  aggregate_type TEXT,
  aggregate_id UUID,
  type TEXT,
  payload JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

Core flows

Create & send invoice

Client ‚Üí POST /invoices (with Idempotency-Key).

Server validates, computes subtotal/total in minor units, writes invoice + line items in a transaction.

Enqueue PDF render & email job; update status: 'sent'.

Store PDF in object storage; email contains a hosted ‚ÄúPay Now‚Äù link.

Pay invoice

Client hits POST /invoices/:id/pay.

Backend ensures one PaymentIntent per invoice (reuse if exists).

Return client_secret to the client to confirm payment via Stripe Elements.

Stripe emits webhooks (e.g., payment_intent.succeeded).

Webhook handler (idempotent) updates payments + invoices.status='paid'.

Webhooks

Verify signature.

Use idempotency table keyed by event.id.

Process asynchronously (queue) to avoid timeouts.

Idempotency

All create/update endpoints require Idempotency-Key.

Persist request hash; if a key is reused with different body, return 409 (conflict).

Retry-safe: client can retry without double effects.

Scale & reliability

Hot partitions: paginate by (created_at, id) and use composite indexes.

Multi-region: region-anchored accounts; write-local/read-global; replicate using logical replication. Webhook processing per region with global de-dupe by event.id.

Queues: DLQs for failed jobs; exponential backoff.

Backfills: use outbox ‚Üí worker ‚Üí Stripe to keep side effects reliable.

Security

OAuth/JWT per account; row-level access checks.

PII minimization; store only necessary customer data.

Encrypt at rest; rotate keys; strict secrets management.

3) API / Product Design ‚Äî Subscriptions (ideal answer)
States

inactive ‚Üí active ‚Üí past_due ‚Üí canceled (+ trialing, paused optional). Billing cycle anchor and proration rules matter.

Minimal endpoints (v1)

POST /v1/subscriptions

GET /v1/subscriptions/:id

DELETE /v1/subscriptions/:id (cancel now or at period end)

POST /v1/subscriptions/:id/pause / /resume (optional)

POST /v1/webhooks/stripe

Request/response examples

Create subscription

POST /v1/subscriptions
Idempotency-Key: 9b9e...

{
  "customer_id": "cus_123",
  "items": [
    { "price_id": "price_basic", "quantity": 1 }
  ],
  "trial_days": 14,
  "payment_behavior": "default_incomplete", 
  "collection_method": "charge_automatically", 
  "coupon_code": "WELCOME10"
}


Response

{
  "id": "sub_abc",
  "status": "trialing",
  "current_period_end": "2025-09-12T00:00:00Z",
  "latest_invoice_id": "inv_987",
  "client_secret": "pi_client_secret_..."  // if payment needed
}


Get

GET /v1/subscriptions/sub_abc


Response includes items, status, next invoice estimate, past_due reasons.

Cancel

DELETE /v1/subscriptions/sub_abc?at_period_end=true

Key behaviors & tradeoffs

Trials: set trial_end = now + N days; convert automatically at period end; remind via email.

Failed payments:

Retry schedule (e.g., 1h, 24h, 3d, 7d).

Dunning: send emails, update portal banner, eventually mark past_due ‚Üí canceled.

Proration:

When changing tier mid-cycle, compute delta for remaining period; optionally disable via proration_behavior=none.

Versioning:

URL versioning (/v1, /v2) + Stripe-Version style header for behavior changes.

Deprecate gracefully with sunset headers and migration docs.

DX:

Consistent error shapes:

{ "error": { "code": "invalid_request", "message": "price_id unknown", "param": "items[0].price_id" } }


Idempotency required for all writes.

Webhook types documented with examples.

SDKs in JS, Python, Java with typed models.

4) Debugging / Deep Dive ‚Äî ‚Äúidempotency key reused‚Äù
Symptom

5% of payments show: PaymentIntent confirmation failed - idempotency key reused.

Likely causes

Client retries with the same idempotency key but a different request body
Stripe treats this as a conflict (safety feature). E.g., first attempt: amount=1000; retry sends amount=1200 with same key ‚Üí failure.

Server reuses a single idempotency key across multiple distinct operations
e.g., same key for different PaymentIntents.

Race conditions
Multiple clicks ‚ÄúPay‚Äù generate concurrent confirmations with one key.

Webhook confusion
App treats webhook re-deliveries as ‚Äúwe should confirm again‚Äù and accidentally re-hits confirm with an old key.

Debug plan (what you‚Äôd say aloud)

Correlate by request_id / idempotency key in logs.

Compare first-seen request body hash vs. retries. If mismatch ‚Üí root cause.

Inspect client code for key generation scope (should be 1:1 with a logical operation).

Check network timeouts: client may retry before server returns, causing double-confirm.

Validate webhook handler is idempotent and never calls confirm.

Sample 20 failures; confirm pattern.

Fixes (code + process)

Generate one idempotency key per logical op, store it, and reuse only if the body is bit-for-bit identical.

Confirm on client only once; disable duplicate clicks; debounce.

Server-side guard:

Keep a table: (idempotency_key, sha256(body), status, result_reference).

On reuse with different sha: respond 409 conflict with stored canonical params.

Backoff & visibility: exponential backoff on 5xx/timeouts; alert on >0.5% conflicts.

NestJS-style patch (sketch)

// middleware: enforce idempotency on writes
@Injectable()
export class IdempotencyMiddleware implements NestMiddleware {
  async use(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    const key = req.header('Idempotency-Key');
    if (!key) return res.status(428).json({ error: { code: 'missing_idempotency_key' }});

    const bodyHash = sha256(JSON.stringify(req.body));
    const existing = await this.repo.findOne({ where: { key } });

    if (!existing) {
      await this.repo.insert({ key, body_hash: bodyHash, status: 'pending' });
      return next();
    }
    if (existing.body_hash !== bodyHash) {
      return res.status(409).json({ error: { code: 'idempotency_conflict' }});
    }
    if (existing.status === 'succeeded') {
      return res.json(existing.cached_response);
    }
    return next(); // pending or failed ‚Üí allow retry
  }
}
